# ToDoListApp

Welcome to the ToDoListApp project! This project showcases the development of a ToDo list application with a back-end developed using Node.js and Express.js, and the front-end developed in Java using Android Studio.

## Project Description

The ToDoListApp allows users to manage their tasks and create to-do lists. The back-end of the application is developed using Node.js and Express.js, providing RESTful APIs for task management. The front-end of the app is built using Java in Android Studio, leveraging the Jackson library for JSON serialization and deserialization. API calls to the back-end are made using OkHttp3 for seamless communication and data mapping into models.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js: The back-end of the ToDoListApp is developed using Node.js.
- Express.js: The Express.js framework is used to create the RESTful APIs for task management.
- Java (Android Studio): The front-end of the app is developed using Java in Android Studio.
- Jackson: Jackson is utilized for JSON serialization and deserialization in the app.
- OkHttp3: OkHttp3 library is used for making API calls and mapping data into models.

## Getting Started

To run the ToDoListApp locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/lmtri2307/TodoListApp`
2. Set up the back-end:
   - Navigate to the `server` directory: `cd server`
   - Install the required dependencies: `yarn install`
   - Run the back-end server: `yarn start`
3. Set up the front-end:
   - Open the Android project in Android Studio located in the `client` directory.
   - Build and run the project on an emulator or physical device.

## Usage

Once the ToDoListApp is running, users can create an account, manage tasks, and create to-do lists through the user-friendly Android interface. API calls are made to the back-end for seamless data management.
